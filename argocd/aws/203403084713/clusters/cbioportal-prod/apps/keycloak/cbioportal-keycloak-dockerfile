# Since 7.0.1, Keycloak has switched to Redhat UBI base images (registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8-minimal) which contains a modified/restrictive version of OpenJDK-11.
# Specifically, the Java security policy did not allow the necessary protocols to connect to MySQL via SSL.  As a result, this Dockerfile was created to replace the
# Java security file found in the latest keycloak Dockerfile with a more permissive security policy found in the general openjdk-11 Dockerfile.
