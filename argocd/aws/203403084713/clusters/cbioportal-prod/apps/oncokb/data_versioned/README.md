# Data versioned instances
This folder includes the deployments for specific data versions. 
We plan to support all data versions through www.oncokb.org but we are still discussing what the best way is to support 50+ veresions.

To deliver the instances to our clients, we now temporary set up the following instances and they are corresponding to a version in the file name.
For instance, [oncokb_public_data_4_0.yaml](oncokb_public_data_4_0.yaml) indicates this is a public website to server data v4.0

- data-4-5.oncokb.org
- data-4-0.oncokb.org
- data-3-11.oncokb.org
